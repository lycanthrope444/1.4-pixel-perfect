          <p>You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I ambattle-tested bayonets, bro. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ....</p>
          <p>And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.  'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to <a href="paragraph-link">judge me.'</a> Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .... That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.</p>

          <p>.... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .... Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the <a href="paragraph-link">Vatican assassins.</a></p>
          <p>The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' -now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.</p>
